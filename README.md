# Aeromano

*Air-powered hand gesture steering interface for hands-free gaming control.*

---

## About the Project

**Aeromano** is an innovative hand-gesture-based virtual steering controller designed for controlling vehicles in PC games using only hand movements in front of your webcam. Built with OpenCV and MediaPipe, Aeromano translates your gestures into keyboard keystrokes, enabling immersive and contactless gaming experiences.

---

## Features

*  **Steering**: Move your right hand left/right to steer (`A`/`D` keys)
*  **Acceleration/Braking**: Raise or lower your left hand to move forward (`W`) or brake/reverse (`S`)
*  **Two-Hand Recognition**: Requires both hands in the frame to activate controls
*  **Game-Compatible**: Works with most PC games that use WASD controls
